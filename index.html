      <h3>British Govt. Firm For An Increase of Fares On Railways</h3>
      <p>
        LONDON, July 30 â€“ the government will stand firm regarding the increase
        of fares on the railways.<br />
        Premier Lloyd George admitted in the House of Commons last night that
        the increases bore heavily on everybody,<br />
        but he added, when wages and material went up at such a prodigious rate
        either the rates must increase or the burden fall upon the taxpayers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charles Higham moved the adjournment of the House, which, however, was
        rejected by 156 to 61,<br />
        the feeling of the majority seemingly being that a postponement of an
        increase, even until after the holiday season, would only mean a still
        greater burden next year.<br />
        The members were also probably impressed by what has been obvious for
        some days,<br />
        and that is the sincere public disapproval of the increases has
        degenerated into something like a mere stunt by newspapers hostile to
        the government.
      </p>

      <h3>English Railways</h3>

      </p>

      <h3>Scottish Railways</h3>
      <p>
